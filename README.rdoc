= padrino-warden

A Padrino (http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework) module that provides authentication for your Padrino application through Warden (http://github.com/hassox/warden).

Most of the code was adapted from sinatra_warden (http://github.com/jsmestad/sinatra_warden)

== Usage

Currently padrino-warden uses +password+ as default authentication strategy. If you wish to change that consult
Warden (http://github.com/hassox/warden).

  class SampleApp < Padrino::Application
    configure do
      ##
      # Application-specific configuration options
      #
    end

    register Padrino::Warden


    class User
      attr_reader :name
      def initialize(name)
        @name=name
      end

      def self.authenticate(a, b)
        return User.new('john')
      end
    end

    Warden::Strategies.add(:password) do
      def valid?
        params["email"] || params["password"]
      end

      def authenticate!
        u = User.authenticate(params["email"], params["password"])
        u.nil? ? fail!("Could not log in") : success!(u)
      end
    end

    Warden::Manager.serialize_into_session do |user|
      user.id
    end

    Warden::Manager.serialize_from_session do |id|
      User.get(id)
    end

  end

Run this to see your new routes:
  $ padrino rake routes

You can now login at
  http://localhost/sessions/login

After login you can fiddle with +current_user+ for anything you need.

== Multi Sub-Apps

You UserApp(/user):

    Register Padrino::Warden

This will mount the sessions controller on it:

    /user/sessions/...

You OtherApps:

    Register Padrino::Warden::Helpers

But you must apply the same options in your UserApp.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
